# Project Description
As a data analyst hired to function as a member of Rockbuster Stealth's Business Intelligence (BI) department, I was tasked with loading Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and then analyzing it in order to develop data-driven answers to a series of business questions related to the company's launch strategy for entry into the online video rental sphere; a move necessary due to competition from online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The specific business questions are as follows: 
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
